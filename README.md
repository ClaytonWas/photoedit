# WebappPhotoedits
Photo manipulation software using JavaScript inspired by applications like Photoshop and Photopea.
Provding filter and image transformations. <br >

# Current Stage
A webapp that serves a photo manipulation user interface to a front-end user using Node.js and Express.js. 

This code is built on a programatic ImageEditor class instance, that handles front end interaction and performs image manipulations with context provided by an imagefile and HTML canvas. If no canvas is provided, it creates one internally. 

Currently in development.
