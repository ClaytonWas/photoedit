# WebappPhotoedits
[website](https://photoedit.ca)

A webapp that serves a photo manipulation user interface to a front-end user using Vite. 

This code is built on a programatic ImageEditor class instance, that handles front end interaction and performs image manipulations with context provided by an imagefile and HTML canvas. If no canvas is provided, it creates one internally. 

### Installation
1. Install packages (built using Node v20.15.1):
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
2. Run vite server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
